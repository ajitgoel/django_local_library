Running database migrations
The makemigrations command creates (but does not apply) the migrations for all applications installed in your project (you can specify the application name as well to just run a migration for a single project). 
py manage.py makemigrations
The migrate command actually applies the migrations to your database (Django tracks which ones have been added to the current database).
py manage.py migrate

Getting your website ready to publish
